The CPU within a computer aloows all other components to communicate to one another through itsekf. It's essentially the middle man, saying what to and what not to do. 
One common theme of CPU's that's widely missunderstood is their clock speed. When this term is used, in simple terms, it's an internal clock that each core runs at. 
I like to think of it like a pendulum that swings slower or faster depending on the CPU's running speed.
